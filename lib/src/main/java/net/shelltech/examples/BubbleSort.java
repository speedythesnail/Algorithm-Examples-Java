/**
 * Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through
 * the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the
 * wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.
 *
 * Time Complexity: Worst-case and average complexity is O(n^2) where n is the
 * number of items being sorted. Best case (already sorted list) is O(n).
 *
 * Space Complexity: O(1), because it only requires a single additional memory
 * space for temp variable.
 *
 * When to use: Bubble Sort can be used when the input size is small, and space
 * complexity is a concern. Itâ€™s also useful for educational purposes due to
 * its simplicity.
