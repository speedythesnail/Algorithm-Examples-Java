# Algorithm-Examples-Java
Examples  of common algorithms written in Java, with unit tests written with the Spock Framework.

## Sorting Algorithms
Understanding various sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, and BubbleSort is crucial. They are often used in questions to test your knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

## Search Algorithms
Binary Search is a must-know algorithm. It’s used in a variety of problems, and understanding it can also help you grasp the concept of time complexity.

## Graph Algorithms
Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and Floyd-Warshall Algorithm are commonly used in problems involving graphs.

## Dynamic Programming
This is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It’s used in various types of problems, such as Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, and Optimal Binary Search Tree.

## String/Array Algorithms
Knowledge of algorithms that operate on strings and arrays is essential. This includes algorithms for reversing a string/array, substring search (Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm), and array rotation.

## Tree Traversals
Pre-order, In-order, Post-order, and Level-order traversals are often asked in interviews.

## Hashing Algorithms
Understanding how hashing works, including collision resolution techniques, is important.

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms
This technique involves dividing the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them independently. Examples include Binary Search, QuickSort, and MergeSort.

## Greedy Algorithms
These algorithms make the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding the global optimum. Examples include Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree, Dijkstra’s Shortest Path, and Huffman Coding.
